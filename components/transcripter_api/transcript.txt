 So, hey there. I hope you are doing alright. I think everything is going as per your requirements. So, just checking in and do let me know if there are any requirements or changes needed for me to do. Actually the thing is the most important thing that I want to say right now to use. I have been facing some issues regarding the transcription as it is a messy pipeline and all the things are not getting transmitted.  transcribe a accordingly. For example, if I talk Hindi, I am talking Hindi. I don't have a transcribe. Thanks.
