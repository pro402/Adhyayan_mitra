      "System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces, and data models for building software systems that meet specific requirements efficiently and effectively. It transforms user requirements into a structured blueprint that guides the development of reliable, scalable, and maintainable software solutions[1].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Definition and Fundamentals\n",
      "\n",
      "System design encompasses planning and structuring complex systems to fulfill both functional and non-functional requirements. It involves making crucial decisions about how different components will interact to achieve desired functionality[2]. A well-designed system aims to be:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Reliable**: Handles faults, failures, and errors gracefully\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Effective**: Meets all user needs and business requirements\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Maintainable**: Remains flexible and easy to scale or modify[9]\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key System Design Principles\n",
      "\n",
      "### SOLID Principles\n",
      "\n",
      "The SOLID principles provide fundamental guidelines for creating robust software:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class or module should have only one reason to change\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Open/Closed Principle**: Systems should be open for extension but closed for modification\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Many specific interfaces are better than one general interface\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Depend on abstractions, not implementations[6][8]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Design for Scalability\n",
      "\n",
      "Scalability is the system's ability to handle increased load without performance degradation. Key strategies include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Horizontal scaling**: Adding more machines to the system\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Vertical scaling**: Adding more power to existing machines\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Load balancing**: Distributing workload across multiple servers[3][7]\n",
      "\n",
      "### Modularity and Simplicity\n",
      "\n",
      "Breaking complex systems into smaller, manageable components makes them easier to develop, test, and maintain. Each module should have a clear purpose with well-defined interfaces, ensuring high cohesion and low coupling[6][7].\n",
      "\n",
      "## System Design Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "An effective approach to system design involves several key steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understand and Define Requirements**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Gather functional requirements (what the system must do)\n",
      "\n",
      "- Identify non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "- Clarify constraints (budget, technology limitations)[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Design Architecture**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Choose appropriate architectural patterns (microservices, event-driven, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "- Establish communication protocols between components\n",
      "\n",
      "- Define data models and storage strategies[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Plan for Data Management**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Select appropriate databases (SQL vs. NoSQL)\n",
      "\n",
      "- Implement data partitioning/sharding strategies\n",
      "\n",
      "- Design for data integrity and consistency[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider Trade-offs**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Performance vs. cost\n",
      "\n",
      "- Simplicity vs. flexibility\n",
      "\n",
      "- Strong consistency vs. high availability[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "## Building Blocks of Modern System Design\n",
      "\n",
      "Modern system design relies on several common building blocks that serve as fundamental components across various systems:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Load Balancers**: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Caching Systems**: Store frequently accessed data for faster retrieval\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Message Queues**: Enable asynchronous communication between components\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Distribute content geographically closer to users[9]\n",
      "\n",
      "## Real-World System Design Examples\n",

    "\n",
    "India faces unique challenges in managing its land resources due to its large population, geographic diversity, and increasing development demands. This report examines the current status, utilization patterns, challenges, and management strategies for India's land resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Land Resource Status and Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "India possesses a total geographical area of approximately 328.73 million hectares[1]. The land resources are classified into several distinct categories that reflect their usage and potential:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forest Land**: Covering 713,789 square kilometers or 21.72% of India's geographical area. Recent assessments show an increase of 1,540 square kilometers in forest cover and 721 square kilometers in tree cover compared to previous assessments[5].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agricultural Land**: Constitutes approximately 46% of the total geographical area as net sown area[1]. This includes:\n",
    "- Arable land concentrated in the Gangetic plains, Punjab, Haryana, and parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka[4]\n",
    "- Current fallow land (temporarily not cultivated during the current agricultural year)\n",
    "- Other fallow land (left uncultivated for 1-5 years)[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pastures and Grazing Land**: Areas designated for livestock grazing, including permanent pastures and meadows[3].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Land Under Miscellaneous Tree Crops**: Areas with tree crops not classified as forests, including orchards and plantations[3].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Culturable Waste Land**: Land potentially suitable for cultivation but currently unused[3].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Barren and Unculturable Land**: Areas that cannot be brought under cultivation due to topography, climate, or soil conditions, comprising about 8.5% of the total geographical area[1].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Land Under Non-Agricultural Uses**: Areas used for settlements, infrastructure, industries, and other development, accounting for approximately 5.5% of the total land area[1]. This category has increased from 17 million hectares to 27 million hectares over the years[7].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Land Utilization Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "The land utilization pattern in India has undergone significant changes over time:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agricultural Land**: The net sown area has remained relatively constant at around 140 million hectares since the 1950s, though the gross cropped area has increased from 166 million hectares in 1971-72 to 197 million hectares in 2015-16, indicating intensification of agriculture[7].\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Forest Cover**: Total forest and tree cover has increased by 2,261 square kilometers compared to previous assessments, demonstrating successful afforestation efforts[5].\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Non-Agricultural Uses**: Land under non-agricultural uses has been steadily increasing due to urbanization, infrastructure development, and economic growth[1][7].\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Barren Land**: Barren and unculturable land has decreased from 28 million hectares in 1971-72 to 17 million hectares in 2015-16, reflecting land reclamation efforts[7].\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cropping Intensity**: Has increased from 118% to 140% between 1971-72 and 2015-16, indicating more intensive use of available agricultural land[7].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Land Degradation: A Critical Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most pressing issues affecting India's land resources is degradation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extent**: Approximately 30% of India's total geographical area (about 115-120 million hectares) is affected by various forms of land degradation and desertification[10][11][13].\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Types of Degradation**:\n",
    "   - Water erosion (11.01% of India's land)\n",
    "   - Vegetation degradation (9.15%)\n",
    "   - Wind erosion (5.46%)\n",
    "   - Soil salinity and alkalinity\n",
    "   - Waterlogging[9][10]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regional Distribution**: Eight states—Rajasthan, Delhi, Goa, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Nagaland, Tripura, and Himachal Pradesh—have 40-70% of their land affected by desertification. Rajasthan alone has over 21 million hectares classified as degraded[10][13].\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Temporal Trends**: 26 out of 29 Indian states have reported an increase in areas undergoing desertification over the past decade[13].\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Wastelands**: The Wastelands Atlas of India (2019) identified 557,665 square kilometers (16.96% of total geographical area) as wastelands in 2015-16, showing a slight decrease from 566,070 square kilometers (17.22%) in 2008-09[6].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Challenges in Land Resource Management\n",
    "\n",
    "India faces multiple challenges in managing its land resources effectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Population Pressure**: With only 2.4% of the world's geographical area supporting over 17% of the global population, India faces acute land scarcity[12]. Per capita land availability is projected to decrease from 0.32 hectares in 2001 to 0.19 hectares by 2050[7].\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agricultural Productivity**: Low crop yields compared to international standards, particularly in rainfed areas growing coarse cereals, pulses, and oilseeds[9].\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Irrigation Dependency**: Only about 33% of cultivated area is irrigated, making the rest dependent on erratic monsoon rainfall[9].\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Land Degradation**: Extensive degradation due to water and wind erosion, soil salinity, alkalinity, and waterlogging affects agricultural productivity[9][10].\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Climate Change Impacts**: Increasing vulnerability to floods, droughts, and temperature variations affecting land productivity and increasing degradation[12].\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Sectoral Approach**: Fragmented land management practices with different government departments following their own approaches[8][12].\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Competing Land Demands**: Growing competition between agriculture and other land-based sectors (urbanization, industrialization, infrastructure) creating conflicts and escalating land prices[12].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Government Initiatives and Management Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Several initiatives have been implemented to address land resource challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Watershed Development**: The Government of India approved the continuation of the Watershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) for 2021-2026 with a physical target of 4.95 million hectares and an indicative financial outlay of ₹8,134 crore[2].\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wasteland Reclamation**: Between 2008-09 and 2015-16, 14,536 square kilometers of wasteland was converted to non-wastelands, resulting in a net reduction of 8,404 square kilometers of wasteland[6].\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Remote Sensing and Mapping**: The National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA) and Space Application Centre (SAC) have been mapping wastelands and monitoring land degradation using satellite imagery[1][10].\n",
    "\n",

    "ex_summarized_text = \"\"\"# Comprehensive Report on Land Resources in India\n",
    "\n",
    "India faces significant challenges in managing its land resources due to population pressure, geographic diversity, and development demands. This report summarizes the current status, utilization patterns, challenges, and management strategies for India's land resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Land Resource Status and Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "India has a total geographical area of approximately 328.73 million hectares, classified into:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forest Land**: Covers 713,789 square kilometers (21.72% of India's area), with recent assessments showing increases in both forest cover (1,540 sq km) and tree cover (721 sq km).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agricultural Land**: Constitutes about 46% of the total geographical area as net sown area, including:\n",
    "- Arable land concentrated in the Gangetic plains, Punjab, Haryana, and parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka\n",
    "- Current fallow land (temporarily not cultivated)\n",
    "- Other fallow land (left uncultivated for 1-5 years)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pastures and Grazing Land**: Areas designated for livestock grazing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Land Under Miscellaneous Tree Crops**: Areas with tree crops not classified as forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Culturable Waste Land**: Land potentially suitable for cultivation but currently unused.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Barren and Unculturable Land**: Areas unsuitable for cultivation (about 8.5% of total area).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Land Under Non-Agricultural Uses**: Areas used for settlements, infrastructure, and industries (approximately 5.5% of total land area), which has increased from 17 million to 27 million hectares over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Land Utilization Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "Key trends in India's land utilization include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agricultural Land**: Net sown area has remained relatively constant at around 140 million hectares since the 1950s, though gross cropped area increased from 166 million hectares (1971-72) to 197 million hectares (2015-16).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Forest Cover**: Total forest and tree cover has increased by 2,261 square kilometers in recent assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Non-Agricultural Uses**: Land under non-agricultural uses has steadily increased due to urbanization and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Barren Land**: Decreased from 28 million hectares (1971-72) to 17 million hectares (2015-16).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cropping Intensity**: Increased from 118% to 140% between 1971-72 and 2015-16.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Land Degradation: A Critical Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Land degradation affects approximately 30% of India's total geographical area (115-120 million hectares):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Types of Degradation**:\n",
    "   - Water erosion (11.01% of India's land)\n",
    "   - Vegetation degradation (9.15%)\n",
    "   - Wind erosion (5.46%)\n",
    "   - Soil salinity, alkalinity, and waterlogging\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regional Distribution**: Eight states—Rajasthan, Delhi, Goa, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Nagaland, Tripura, and Himachal Pradesh—have 40-70% of their land affected by desertification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temporal Trends**: 26 out of 29 Indian states have reported increasing desertification over the past decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Wastelands**: The Wastelands Atlas identified 557,665 square kilometers (16.96% of total area) as wastelands in 2015-16, down from 566,070 square kilometers (17.22%) in 2008-09.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Challenges in Land Resource Management\n",
    "\n",
    "India faces multiple challenges in effective land resource management:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Population Pressure**: With only 2.4% of the world's geographical area supporting over 17% of global population, per capita land availability is projected to decrease from 0.32 hectares (2001) to 0.19 hectares by 2050.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agricultural Productivity**: Low crop yields compared to international standards, particularly in rainfed areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Irrigation Dependency**: Only about 33% of cultivated area is irrigated, making the rest dependent on erratic monsoon rainfall.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Land Degradation**: Extensive degradation affecting agricultural productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Climate Change Impacts**: Increasing vulnerability to floods, droughts, and temperature variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Sectoral Approach**: Fragmented land management practices across different government departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Competing Land Demands**: Growing competition between agriculture and other land-based sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Government Initiatives and Management Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Several initiatives address land resource challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Watershed Development**: Continuation of the Watershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) for 2021-2026, targeting 4.95 million hectares with an outlay of ₹8,134 crore.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wasteland Reclamation**: Between 2008-09 and 2015-16, 14,536 square kilometers of wasteland was converted to non-wastelands.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Remote Sensing and Mapping**: Using satellite imagery to map wastelands and monitor land degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Soil Health Initiatives**: Programs like the Soil Health Card Scheme to help farmers better manage their fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Forest Conservation**: Efforts showing positive results with increased forest and tree cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations for Sustainable Land Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Approaches to enhance sustainable land management include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-Stakeholder Platforms**: Establish platforms at district and sub-district levels for collaborative land management.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Landscape Approach**: Adopt a comprehensive approach to assess land potential and make informed decisions.\n",
